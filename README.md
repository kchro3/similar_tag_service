## Running locally

I'm using PyCharm CE. In my IDE Terminal, I can run this command to spin up a local web server running 
on `http://localhost:3000`:

```commandline
âžœ uvicorn src.main:app --reload    
```

## Testing locally

TODO: Need to remember how pytest works. Maybe there are other testing frameworks to look into.
